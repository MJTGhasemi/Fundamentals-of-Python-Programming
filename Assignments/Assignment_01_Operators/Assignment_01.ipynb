    "**Exercise 1:** Write a Python program to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle with width 7 and height 5. Use arithmetic operators to calculate both values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 2:** Given three grades, 88, 76, and 91, write a Python script to calculate the average grade. Use variables to store the grades and the arithmetic operators to calculate the average.\n",
