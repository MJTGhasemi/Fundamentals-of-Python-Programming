    "- **Simplicity:** Rather than focusing on the entire problem at hand, a module typically focuses on one relatively small portion of the problem. If you’re working on a single module, you’ll have a smaller problem domain to wrap your head around. This makes development easier and less error-prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Maintainability:** Modules are typically designed so that they enforce logical boundaries between different problem domains. If modules are written in a way that minimizes interdependency, there is decreased likelihood that modifications to a single module will have an impact on other parts of the program. (You may even be able to make changes to a module without having any knowledge of the application outside that module.) This makes it more viable for a team of many programmers to work collaboratively on a large application.\n",

    "- **Reusability:** Functionality defined in a single module can be easily reused (through an appropriately defined interface) by other parts of the application. This eliminates the need to duplicate code.\n",

This allows for modular and organized code development, where the same name can be safely used in different modules without fear of name collisions.\n",

    "For example, two different modules might both define a function called calculate, but since each function exists within the separate namespace of its respective module, they won't interfere with each other.

    "\n",
    "The `main.py` file imports the `Library`, `Book`, and `ui` modules. The main function performs the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creates an instance of Library**: Initializes the library to manage the collection of books.\n",
    "2. **Enters an infinite loop**: Displays a menu and handles user choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Menu Options\n",
    "\n",
    "The menu offers several options:\n",
    "- **Adding a new book to the library**: Prompts the user for book details and adds the book to the library.\n",
    "- **Removing a book by its ISBN**: Allows the user to remove a book by entering its ISBN.\n",
    "- **Finding and displaying a book by its ISBN**: Lets the user find and display details of a book by entering its ISBN.\n",
    "- **Listing all books in the library**: Displays a list of all books currently in the library.\n",
    "- **Exiting the program**: Ends the infinite loop and exits the program.\n",

    "### Entry Point Check\n",
    "\n",
    "The entry point check (`if __name__ == '__main__':`) ensures that the main function runs when the script is executed directly.\n"
